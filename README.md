### Hi there 👋 I'm Catzkorn 
| [Blog](https://catzkorn.dev) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catzkorn) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/catzkorn) | [CV](https://github.com/Catzkorn/digital-cv) |

Currently based in the UK 🇬🇧; soon to be Canada 🇨🇦🍁! 

I'm passionate about backend development, curious about dev-ops and security, a budding Gopher and oversharer of gifs on twitter. In the past four years, I have survived a life threatening illness, left a PhD, gone on a journey of self discovery, and found the thing that drives me: software engineering. Learning to code has reawakened a lifelong passion for technology, learning and innovation I thought I had lost. My bootcamp experience has provided me with a foundation, and now I am searching for a role to grow as a developer. Leaning on the skills I acquired during my research, such as project and time management, allows me to be a valuable contributor to my team. 

I know what I want in the next four years, and I want to become a _damn good_ software engineer.

Charlotte
